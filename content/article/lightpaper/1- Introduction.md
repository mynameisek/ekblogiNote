# TURFU
---
### **Engage with the World *Paradigm Shift***
### **A complete knowledge base, ecosystem and platforms to engage with the real world**
---
**ACTION < T > RESEARCH**

### **Build the *Turfu*** : 

TURFU (Futur) is a new concept illustrating how the different narration of the Futur, are impacting our Present. 
Turfu is complete decentralized ecosystem and gateway toward a common, viable and substainable futur, built by us, on the most legitimate and available ressources, opening bifurcations to dystopian visions of the future.

The futur we want, impact our everyday choices and organizations, and our everyday choices create the futur. So What to do ? Can we even do something ?

> *You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete (**Buckminster Fuller**)*

- An ecosystem that supports the emergence of narratives and research on potential futures that are desirable and attainable
- Spaces that encourage their experimentation and implementation in the real world, through self-sovereign, interoperable, censorship and privacy-resistant human organizations using the power of new crypto-economies, DLT, P2P and collective intelligence.
 

The current era is disorienting because of the complexity of the issues at stake and the uncertainties they generate. We are at a crossroads and there is deep disagreement as to the direction to take in order to avoid dystopian futures (transhumanism, ecological and social collapse, control societies). Thinking about a world that will be joyful and sustainable tomorrow invites us to question all the areas that structure our life as a whole: democracy, economy, ecology, digital, media, work, demography... A transdisciplinary analysis that also leads us to reconsider the scales of our territories, our governance, our relationship to ourselves, to the other and to the environment... 


How to create the most legitimate, sustainable, ecosystem of human organizations based on the most robust knowledge and technology we have available, and make it happen right now ?!  

Using the power of crypto-economy, DLT, P2P and collective intelligence
In the name of an organic architecture of our societies and an open Science

**The alternative of the Great Reset**
**Join the real decentralized Meta(re)verse,
engaging directly with the real world issues bridging the gap between old centralized systems and a new economy based on robust knowledge** : TURFU Ecosystem

Covid crisis highlighted how fragile our human organizations are. It also brought another opportunity to become aware of the nature of our organizations and their legitimacy. 
As we base our organizations and decisions on concepts like information, trust, legitimacy, autority... The covid confusion helped understanding the inability of current models to respond to human complexity of the current reality. 
We need new science, new models, new logics, new organizations, new economy, new education and we have it avalaible in the new decentralized cryptoeconomic experiments and new knowledge to support this vision brought from latest scientific discoveries and tech innovations.
How to select and democratize the best of it to support a new autonomous and sustainable world organization and an open transdisciplinary science and protect this meta-ethical vision forever ? Towards self-sovereign individuals and self-determination with interoperable organizations working on a common sustainable futur.
